# HungerFree
The purpose of HungerFree is to free India from hunger. Everyday over 20 crores Indians go to sleep hungry. This problem can be solved by tackling the food wastage problem that occurs during big Indian weddings, Restaurants etc. HungerFree is a platform that provides a solution to this problem by connecting restaurants, various NGOs to the needy. 
HungerFree is a web app designed and developed keeping in mind the difficulties NGOs or restaurants face to reach out to people. 


### Novelty 
HungerFree is an initiative to help feed hungry stomachs. It will help mankind  in curbing hunger.Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people experiencing hunger globally and suffering from food insecurity had been rising gradually since 2014. The pandemic has increased the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems, potentially leaving hundreds of millions more people chronically undernourished and making the goal of ending hunger more difficult to achieve. Between 83 and 132 million more people may already have been pushed into chronic hunger in 2020.Around 67 million tonnes of food is wasted in India every year which has been valued at around Rs 92,000 crores. For context, this amount is enough to feed all of Bihar for a year.Food waste is an issue of importance to global food security and the environment.
And Since this is an issue of grave concern, we as the people of the society thought about it, that in what ways can we give back to our society, for the well being of the society. And then we came across the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDC) by the UN.
FOOD MANAGEMENT IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR AND HungerFree IS THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.
